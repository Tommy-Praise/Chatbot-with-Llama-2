#Llama 2 NLP Toolkit
Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of the Llama 2 model from Hugging Face to build a sentiment-aware chatbot and perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The project utilizes Hugging Face Transformers, covering everything from setting up a pre-trained language model to executing sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition (NER), text summarization, and question-answering.

The sentiment-aware chatbot adjusts its responses based on the sentiment of the user's input, improving user interaction by delivering contextually and emotionally appropriate replies.

Features
Sentiment-Aware Chatbot: Integrates sentiment analysis to tailor chatbot responses.
Text Generation: Generates human-like text based on input prompts using the Llama 2 model.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies entities (like names, places) within the text.
Text Summarization: Summarizes long pieces of text into concise summaries.
Question Answering: Provides precise answers based on context using pre-trained models.
Learning Outcomes
Load and configure pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
Perform various NLP tasks using Llama 2 and other Hugging Face models.
Develop an interactive chatbot that can adjust its responses based on user sentiment.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Hugging Face Transformers
PyTorch
Hugging Face Hub account (optional for access tokens)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama2-nlp-toolkit.git
cd llama2-nlp-toolkit
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install accelerate protobuf sentencepiece torch transformers huggingface_hub
Set up environment in Google Colab (optional):
Open a Google Colab notebook.
Switch the runtime to GPU.
Follow the provided tutorial steps.
Usage
Loading Pre-Trained Llama 2 Model:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_id = "NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
Text Generation:

python
Copy code
sample_prompt = "Hello, how are you?"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(sample_prompt, return_tensors="pt").to('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
Sentiment Analysis Integration:

Sentiment analysis model allows the chatbot to adapt responses. Use this pipeline:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = sentiment_analyzer("I'm feeling great!")
print(result)
Based on the result, adjust the chatbot's response logic.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english")
sentence = "Apple is building a campus in Austin."
print(ner_pipeline(sentence))
Text Summarization:

python
Copy code
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
long_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog..."
summary = summarizer(long_text, max_length=50, min_length=25)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
Question Answering:

python
Copy code
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model="deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
context = "Apple Inc. is an American technology company..."
question = "Where is Apple Inc. headquartered?"
answer = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
print(answer['answer'])
